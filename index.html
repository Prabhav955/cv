                <h3> <strong>Hello, my name is Prabhav, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science <br>
                    at Poornima Institute of Engineering and Technology. I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student with a <br>
                    strong passion for technology and its applications. My journey in education began at M.D. Jain Public <br>
                    School, where I completed my secondary education.<br>
            
                    Being in the field of computer science, I am fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and its <br>
                     impact on various industries. I enjoy exploring different programming languages and learning about<br>
                      cutting-edge software development practices. My goal is to acquire a solid foundation in computer <br>
                      science principles and apply them to create innovative solutions that can positively impact society.<br>
                    
                    Aside from academics, I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. During my free time,<br>
                     I engage in various hobbies and interests. I am an avid reader, particularly enjoying books on <br>
                     technology, science fiction, and personal development. I also have a keen interest in sports, <br>
                     especially football, and actively participate in friendly matches with my friends.<br>
                    
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I believe in the importance of personal growth and continuous <br>
                    learning. I am always open to new experiences, challenges, and opportunities that broaden my horizons. <br>
                    I am a proactive and collaborative team player, and I enjoy working with others to achieve shared goals.<br>
                    
                    As I continue my educational journey, I aspire to leverage my skills, knowledge, and experiences <br>
                    to contribute to the field of computer science and make a positive impact in the technological landscape. <br>
